## Architecture Components

### 1. Core Agent Structure (`agent.py`)

The main `Agent` class serves as the central orchestrator with the following key components:

**Core Components:**

- **Skill Development System**: Experience-based learning and skill progression

**Key Features:**
- Threaded execution with concurrent module processing
- Skill-aware decision making and performance tracking
- Agent-to-agent skill teaching capabilities
- Real-time performance monitoring and learning sessions

### 2. Agent State (`agent_state.py`)

The `AgentState` class manages all agent data:

```
AgentState Structure:

│   ├── name, role, traits
│   └── personality_traits (persistent characteristics)
├── Memory Systems
│   ├── working_memory (immediate processing)
│   ├── short_term_memory (recent events)
│   ├── long_term_memory (persistent storage)
│   ├── spatial_memory (MemoryTree)
│   ├── associative_memory (ConceptNode-based)
