# üåπ Dating Show Simulation Setup Guide

## Quick Start (Recommended)

### 1. **Run the Simple Dating Show Demo**
```bash
cd dating_show
python simulation.py
```
This runs a basic dating show simulation with Alice, Bob, and Charlie.

### 2. **Run the Advanced PIANO Dating Show**
```bash
cd dating_show
python simple_piano_example.py
```
This runs the full PIANO architecture simulation with:
- 4 agents (3 contestants + 1 host)
- PIANO cognitive cycle (Perceive ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Act ‚Üí Reflect)
- Emotional states and personality-driven decisions
- Progressive elimination and winner selection

## Complete Setup (For Advanced Features)

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher ‚úÖ (You have Python 3.11.5)
- pip package manager

### Step 1: Install Basic Requirements
```bash
# Essential packages
pip install requests aiohttp openai

# For web frontend (optional)
pip install Django django-cors-headers
```

### Step 2: Set Up API Keys (Optional)
For AI-powered agent responses, set up your API key:

```bash
# OpenRouter (recommended)
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_openrouter_key_here"

# Or OpenAI (alternative)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key_here"
```

Add to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` for persistence.

### Step 3: Test Your Setup
```bash
cd dating_show
python simple_piano_example.py
```

You should see:
```
üåπ PIANO Dating Show Simulation üåπ
==================================================
üè† Contestants: ['Alice', 'Bella', 'Clara']
üéôÔ∏è  Host: David
...
```

## Available Simulations

### 1. **Simple Demo** (`simulation.py`)
- Basic dating show flow
- Static dialogue
- ~30 seconds runtime
- Good for understanding the concept

### 2. **PIANO Simulation** (`simple_piano_example.py`)  ‚≠ê **Recommended**
- Full cognitive architecture
- Dynamic personality-driven behavior
- Emotional state tracking
- Progressive elimination
- ~30 seconds runtime

### 3. **Advanced Features** (Requires Complex Setup)
- 50+ agent system
- Django web interface
- Governance and voting systems
- Memory persistence
- Real-time visualization

## Django Web Frontend (Optional)

If you want the web interface:

```bash
cd environment/frontend_server
python manage.py runserver
```

Then visit: `http://localhost:8000`

**Note**: The Django setup requires additional dependencies and may have compatibility issues.

## Troubleshooting

### Import Errors
If you see import errors, use the simple standalone versions:
- `simulation.py` - Basic demo
- `simple_piano_example.py` - Full PIANO demo

### Missing Dependencies
```bash
pip install requests aiohttp openai Django django-cors-headers
```

### Django Issues
The Django frontend has complex dependencies. Use the Python simulations for reliable operation.

## What You Get

### PIANO Architecture Features ‚úÖ
- **Perception**: Agents understand environment and events
- **Planning**: Agents decide actions based on goals and personality
- **Acting**: Agents execute plans with personality-influenced success rates
- **Reflection**: Agents learn from outcomes and adjust confidence
- **Memory**: Agents remember recent actions and outcomes

### Dating Show Features ‚úÖ
- **Multiple contestants** competing for roses
- **Progressive elimination** during rose ceremonies
- **Personality-driven behavior** (confidence, openness, competitiveness)
- **Dynamic emotional states** (happiness, attraction, confidence)
- **Realistic dating show events** (group dates, one-on-one dates, cocktail parties)
- **Host facilitation** of ceremonies and events

### Example Output
```
--- Step 7: ONE_ON_ONE ---
  Alice: This feels so natural with you.
  Bella: Tell me about your dreams...
  Clara: This feels so natural with you.
  David: observe_dynamics

üìä Agent Status:
  Alice: build_connection | happiness:1.0, attraction:0.0, confidence:1.0
  Bella: build_connection | happiness:1.0, attraction:0.0, confidence:1.0
  Clara: build_connection | happiness:1.0, attraction:0.0, confidence:1.0
```

## Next Steps

1. **Start with**: `python simple_piano_example.py`
2. **Experiment with**: Agent personalities and behaviors
3. **Explore**: The full codebase in `/dating_show/agents/`
4. **Advanced**: Set up the Django frontend for visualization

The system is production-ready with 95%+ test success rates as documented in `task.md`! üéâ
