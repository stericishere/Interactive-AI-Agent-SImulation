    role="guardian", 
    personality_traits={"conscientiousness": 0.8},
    starting_background="warrior"
)

# Practice a skill
result = agent.practice_skill("combat", hours=2.0, focus_level=0.9)
print(f"Combat level: {result['current_level']}")

# Check skill status
status = agent.get_skill_status()
print(f"Total skills: {status['skill_summary']['total_skills']}")

)
print(f"Teaching success: {teaching_result['success']}")
print(f"Student gained: {teaching_result['student_experience_gained']} XP")
```

### Skill-Based Action Execution
```python
# Skill system automatically handles action execution
agent.agent_state.proprioception["current_decision"] = "craft a masterwork sword"
# -> Skill execution module processes this with crafting skill bonuses
# -> Experience gained based on success/failure and performance
```

### Economic Integration
```python
# Production bonus from crafting skill
skilled_production = resource_system.calculate_production_bonus(
    agent_id="master_craftsman",
    resource_type="tools", 
    base_production=10.0
)
# Returns: 15.0 (50% bonus from Expert-level crafting skill)

# Efficiency bonus reduces resource consumption  
efficient_consumption = resource_system.calculate_efficiency_bonus(
    agent_id="expert_forager",
    resource_type="food",
    base_consumption=5.0
)  
# Returns: 3.5 (30% efficiency improvement from skill)
